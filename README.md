# Ivanti coding test #

Welcome to the Ivanti coding test.

The purpose of this test is to verify your ability to refactor code to make it testable and your ability to write tests.

The solution contains 2 projects:
* CodingTest_Service: contains the UserService class with a single `GetUsername()` method
* CodingTest_Test: contains the test class for this method

The objective of this test is simple: **make the UserService class testable and add full test coverage for the `GetUsername()` method**. The repository class can be modified but the `GetUser()` method must be left as it is.

Please create a branch on this repository and push your code to this branch.
